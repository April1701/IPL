         <font size= 4 face= georgia color= black ALIGN ="right">
            IPL 2021 new schedule is here. IPL 2021 will begin from September 19 and the final of IPL 2021 will take place on October 10. The remaining 31 matches of IPL 2021 will be split into  10 double headers, 7 single headers, and 4 playoffs.
         <br>
        IPL 2021 New Dates Slot: When Will IPL 2021 Resume?<br><br>
        Slot 1 (September)- The first slot that is available for the BCCI to resume the tournament is in the month of September. However, England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Afghanistan have got all their calendars packed during this window. This leaves only Australian and West Indian players available in the September window for the BCCI to resume IPL 2021.<br><br></font>
       
Slot 2 (November)- The second slot that the BCCI can look forward to continuing the IPL this year is in the November window after the completion of the ICC T20 World Cup 2021. As per the tentative schedule, the ICC T220 World Cup will take place from October 18 to November 15 and thus, the BCCI can look to conduct the tournament after the tournament.<br><br>
IPL 2021 New Possible Venues:<br><br>
BCCI President Sourav Ganguly has made it clear that the resumption of IPL 2021 can’t take place in India. Hence, it is now clear that the tournament will have to be shifted to another country. <br><br>

Venue 1 (England)- As the English, New Zealand, and Indian players will be in England from the month of June, England could be a suitable venue for the BCCI to conduct the tournament. <br><br>

Venue 2 (UAE)- As the COVID-19 pandemic in India surged in 2020, the 13th edition of IPL, IPL 2020 had to be moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The tournament in UAE was a massive success as the authorities were able to ensure that no player or support staff came in contact with the coronavirus. Hence, it could be a very safe option for BCCI to conduct the tournament in UAE.<br><br>

Venue 3 (Sri Lanka)- Sri Lanka Cricket had offered to host the remainder of IPL 2021 in their country. BCCI has also informed that a second-string Indian team will be in Sri Lanka in the month of July to play a three-match ODI and a three-match T20I series.<br><br></font>

            Australia's white-ball skipper Aaron Finch has expressed his "surprise" at so many players pulling out of the tours of the West Indies and Bangladesh and said that "they would find it hard to justify going back and playing the second half of the Indian Premier League (IPL)".

Seven Australian cricket stars, including Pat Cummins, Steve Smith and David Warner, pulled out of their national team's upcoming limited-overs tours of the two countries as Cricket Australia (CA) recently announced an 18-member squad.

Cummins, Glenn Maxwell, Warner, Smith, Marcus Stoinis, Jhye Richardson and Kane Richardson have confirmed their withdrawal from the upcoming tours following which CA head selector Trevor Hohns said that he was "naturally disappointed not to have all players available for the Australian team".
