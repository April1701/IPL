<h2>Franchise history</h2>
<p>
The IPL is a cricket league organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The inaugural tournament 
was held in April–June 2008, in which BCCI finalised a list of eight teams who participated in the tournament. The teams represented eight different cities in India, including Delhi.
The teams were put up for auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008, and the Delhi team was bought by the property development company GMR Group for US$84 million.
</p>
<p>
In March 2018, GMR sold a 50% stake in the Delhi Daredevils to JSW Sports for ₹550 crore (US$77 million).
</p>
<p>
In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals. Speaking to the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman 
Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals. Co-owner Kiran Kumar Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes 
Delhi’s identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the centre of all action going forward.

The 2021 IPL season was held in India. All teams were scheduled to play at neutral venues (no team played at their home ground). On March 30, 2021, Delhi Capitals officially 
promoted Rishabh Pant to captain of the squad after Shreyas Iyer dislocated his shoulder while fielding a ball in the ODI series against England and consequently, was ruled out 
of the 2021 IPL season. Delhi Capitals had 3 matches at the Wankhede Stadium, followed by 2 in Chennai, 4 in Ahmedabad and 5 in Kolkata. Delhi Capitals had won 6 games out 
of 8 matches and were placed at the top of the points table before the season was indefinitely suspended following a breach of the Covid-19 bio secure bubble.
