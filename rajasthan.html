<b>The Rajasthan Royals (RR)</b> are a franchise cricket team based in Jaipur, Rajasthan, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). 
Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight IPL franchises, the team is based at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. The Royals are known to unearth obscure, 
high potential talent, as well as for their involvement in a number of controversies and scandals.
</p>
<p>
The team won the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written off as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were 
also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 under Rahul Dravid's captaincy

<h2>Franchise history</h2>

<p>
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in September 2007, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008. 
The Rajasthan Royals were one of the original eight teams in the inaugural season of the IPL in 2008. The team was sold to the Emerging Media for $67 million, making it the least 
expensive team in the league.
</p>
<p>
The franchise is currently owned and chaired by Manoj Badale. Other investors include Lachlan Murdoch, Aditya S Chellaram, and Suresh Chellaram. The Group acquired the 
franchise for $67 million. There have been past controversies regarding the ownership of the franchise, leading to their expulsion from the league in 2010. Incidentally, this 
was the least expensive franchise in the Indian Premier League and probably the least fancied team in the league at the beginning of the tournament. It made a pre-tax profit 
of $7.5 million in 2009.
